<!--
Notes:
BlockDefinitions is the root of the tree. From there, we define packages, and blocks inside those packages.
Blocks contain a name, type, contains element, and properties element. 
  -Name is a string representing the block in the program.
  -Type is either STATEMENT or PLUGIN, and determines broadly where it can be placed in the program.
  -Contains holds the list of displayed elements of the block. E.g. in an if block, it'd have the prompt "If", followed by the sockets for a conditional.
    -socket elements contain a string representing what is allowed in them (e.g. VARIABLE, or VARIABLE/METHOD/CONSTANT)
  -Properties holds various data or true/false flags. This determines aspects like limiting its behavior, or refining where it can be placed, etc.
    -Ideally properties should all be optional, except for maybe the block's display color. 

-None of the example blocks I've made so far have listed a textbox element.
  -sample:
  <contains>
    etc.
    <textbox>STRING</textbox>
    etc.
  </contains>
  -Internal string would determine what can be entered into it
  
-This should cover most, if not all, of the blocks listed in Garrett's block details file. Only things remaining would be to list out all possible properties.
-Will blocks themselves handle their function (how does an 'if' know to behave?) and have that function be listed somewhere in this XML? 
  -Probably question for much later

Misc.
-look and feel of blocks should communicate their function
  -plugins and statements should look different in some way for ease of use

-As an aside I love the 'end' block. Will make things much, much easier.
